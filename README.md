<i>Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water
  
put water into a cup, it becomes the cup

put water into a teapot, it becomes the teapot

Now Water can Flow or creep or drip or crash

Be Water my friend</i>



These words from Bruce Lee has stuck in my mind for a long time now, and that is how I aspire to live
